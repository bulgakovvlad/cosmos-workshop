# Tgrade

The case for a public, decentralised, secure blockchain is strong. Public blockchains are resilient by design as they are run by a group of independent node operators who are aligned through a framework of incentives and punishments.

Tgrade is a chain that has been designed to support high value businesses in a very secure and decentralised model that is robust and safe.
